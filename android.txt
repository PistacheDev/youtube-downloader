To use the program on Android, you need an application capable of interpreting (executing) Python code.
For example, I used “Pydroid 3” to port the program to Android, which allows you to code and execute Python scripts on an Android device.
Installation link (Google Play Store): https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ru.iiec.pydroid3&hl=fr&pli=1.

You are free to choose your interpreter software.
However, when you download a video at a resolution other than 360p, the process takes longer.
This is because videos downloaded at resolutions other than 360p do not have sound, possibly due to YouTube limitations.
To get a video with sound, the audio and video tracks are assembled using the “ffmpeg” tool, which can be quite demanding for a smartphone or tablet.

Don’t worry, the program installs and manages ffmpeg automatically for you!
Thank you for choosing this program for your Android device!
